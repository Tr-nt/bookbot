BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

A CLI limited scope analysis tool for books

This is an initial project aimed to directly utilize CLI functionality,
while learning to navigate around VIM.

Program is meant to be executed on a local machine and will require a document
that is allowed for the program to properly function.
